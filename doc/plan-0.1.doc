# Milestone 0.1 plan:

  - Support facts, not inferences yet:

    ```js
    import { DB } from '../my/module.js'

    irl.assert(
        DB.person('Serhii').isParentOf('Polina')
    )

    irl.assert([
        DB.person('Nadya').isParentOf('Katya'),
        DB.person('Yura').isParentOf('Katya')
    ])
    ```

  - Support this playground type:

    - User can enter a name in an input box field
    - User can enter pairs, i.e. data for a binary predicate, e.g. `loves`
    - User can enter a name to follow: either "whom does X love?" or "who loves X?"
    - User should see how these observed lists are populated with new data as it's added
      by those pairs.

  - The same but with Node.js, no browser:
    - Just a console app accepting input and notifying of changed projections with
      console.log

  - Even simpler, for starters:
    - Module-level assertions of some fact
    - Make a rule that does some side effect (writes to console.log)
    - Then call `irl.stabilize()`
